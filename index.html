            <p>Welcome to PureSkin. This document serves as both our <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> and <strong>Terms
                    of Service</strong>. By downloading, accessing, or using the PureSkin mobile application, you agree
                to be bound by these terms.</p>
            <p>PureSkin is designed to help you understand skincare ingredients through barcode scanning and AI
                analysis. Please read this document carefully to understand how we handle your data and the limitations
                of our service.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- PRIVACY POLICY -->
        <section id="privacy-policy">
            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

            <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>We collect minimal data necessary to provide our services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> If you create an account, we store your User ID (via Firebase
                    Authentication). We do not store passwords; authentication is handled securely by Google/Firebase.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Product Data:</strong> Barcodes you scan, photos of products or ingredients you upload, and
                    any text corrections you submit.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Anonymous, aggregated analytics about how you interact with the app
                    (e.g., screens visited, buttons clicked) to help us improve performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device type and operating system version for troubleshooting
                    and optimization.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>We DO NOT collect:</strong> Medical records, biometric data, precise location data, or payment
                card details (payments are processed entirely by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store).</p>

            <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p>Your data is used to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide ingredient analysis and product insights.</li>
                <li>Manage your account and sync your scan history.</li>
                <li>Improve the accuracy of our product database through crowd-sourced contributions.</li>
                <li>Detect and prevent fraud or abuse of the service.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. AI & Automated Processing (xAI / Grok)</h3>
            <p>PureSkin uses artificial intelligence services provided by <strong>xAI (Grok models)</strong> to process
                and analyze ingredient information.</p>
            <p>You acknowledge and agree to the following data usage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Model Improvement:</strong> Product-related data sent to xAI (such as ingredient text lists,
                    OCR outputs, and anonymized product metadata) may be processed in accordance with <a
                        href="https://x.ai/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">xAI’s Privacy Policy</a> and may be
                    used by xAI to evaluate, train, or refine their AI models to improve performance and reliability.
                </li>
                <li><strong>No PII Transmission:</strong> PureSkin does not transmit personally identifiable user
                    information (PII) to xAI. Only product-specific content is shared for analysis.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. User-Generated Content</h3>
            <p>When you submit photos, new products, corrections, or other content to PureSkin ("Contributions"):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Public Availability:</strong> By submitting product images, ingredient photos, corrections,
                    or other content to PureSkin, you acknowledge and agree that this content may be reviewed, modified,
                    stored, and made publicly available within the application after administrative approval.</li>
                <li><strong>Database Improvement:</strong> User-submitted content may be used to improve the overall
                    quality, accuracy, and completeness of the PureSkin product database for the benefit of all users.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Review Process:</strong> All contributions are subject to administrative review. We reserve
                    the right to reject or modify content that does not meet our standards.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Data Storage & Security</h3>
            <p>We use <strong>Google Firebase</strong> (Firestore, Storage, and Cloud Functions) to securely store and
                process data. We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information. However, no
                method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

            <h3>6. Data Retention</h3>
            <p>We retain your account data as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, your personal
                profile data is removed. However, anonymized product contributions (such as corrected ingredient lists
                and product photos) will be retained in our database indefinitely to ensure service continuity for other
                users.</p>

            <h3>7. User Rights</h3>
            <p>Depending on your location (including GDPR for EU users), you have the right to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Access the personal data we hold about you.</li>
                <li>Request correction of inaccurate data.</li>
                <li>Request deletion of your account and personal data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can exercise these rights directly within the app settings or by contacting us.</p>

            <h3>8. Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>PureSkin is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or 16 in certain jurisdictions). We do not
                knowingly collect personal data from children. If we become aware that we have collected such data, we
                will take steps to delete it immediately.</p>
