            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

            <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>

                <li><strong>Advertising data (Google AdMob):</strong> Advertising ID, ad interactions (impressions and
                    clicks), device information, and coarse location (for example, city/region) for ad delivery and
                    measurement.</li>
                <li><strong>Subscription data:</strong> Purchase status and entitlement information provided by the
                    Apple App Store/Google Play and RevenueCat.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>We do not collect:</strong> Precise location, medical records, biometric identifiers, or payment
                card numbers. Payments are processed by the Apple App Store or Google Play.</p>

            <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p>Your data is used to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide ingredient analysis, product insights, and personalized content.</li>
                <li>Manage your account, favorites, ratings, and contribution history.</li>
                <li>Operate rewarded ads and subscription entitlements.</li>
                <li>Improve the accuracy of our product database and app experience.</li>
                <li>Detect, prevent, and investigate fraud or abuse.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Device Permissions</h3>
            <p>We request access to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To scan product barcodes.</li>
                <li><strong>Photos/Storage:</strong> To upload product or ingredient photos for contributions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can manage permissions in your device settings.</p>

            <h3>4. AI & Automated Processing (xAI/Grok and Google Cloud Vision)</h3>
            <p>We use AI and OCR to analyze ingredient information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>xAI (Grok models):</strong> Ingredient lists and product context may be processed by xAI to
                    generate summaries and insights. This processing is governed by <a
                        href="https://x.ai/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank">xAI's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Google Cloud Vision OCR:</strong> Ingredient list photos may be processed to extract text.
                    This processing is governed by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's
                        Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>No PII Transmission:</strong> We do not send personally identifiable information (such as
                    name or email) to AI or OCR providers. Only product-related content is shared.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>5. Advertising (Google AdMob)</h3>
            <p>Free users may see ads served by Google AdMob, including rewarded ads for credits. AdMob may collect or
                receive your advertising ID, device information, coarse location, and ad interaction data to show and
                measure ads. You can control ad personalization through your device settings (for example, by limiting
                ad tracking or resetting your advertising ID).</p>
            <p>We do not sell personal data for monetary consideration. Some jurisdictions may consider the use of ad
                identifiers for personalized ads a "sale" or "sharing." You can limit this through your device
                settings.</p>
            <p>For more information, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy
                    Policy</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank">AdMob
                    policies</a>.</p>

            <h3>6. Analytics & Crash Reporting</h3>
            <p>We use Firebase Analytics to understand app usage and Firebase Crashlytics to diagnose crashes. These
                services may collect device identifiers, app events, and technical diagnostics as described in <a
                    href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase's Privacy Policy</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>7. Data Sharing</h3>
            <p>We share data only with trusted service providers that help operate the app:</p>
            <ul>

                business transfer (such as a merger or acquisition).</p>

            <h3>8. Data Storage & Security</h3>
            <p>We use Google Firebase (Firestore, Storage, and Cloud Functions) to securely store and process data. We
                implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information. However, no method of
                transmission over the internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

            <h3>9. Data Retention</h3>
            <p>We retain your account data for as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, your
                personal profile data is removed. Anonymized or aggregated contribution data (such as corrected
                ingredient lists and product photos) may be retained to maintain database integrity. Recent scans are
                stored locally on your device and can be cleared by deleting app data.</p>

            <h3>10. User Rights</h3>
            <p>Depending on your location (including GDPR for EU users), you have the right to:</p>

            </ul>
            <p>You can exercise these rights in the app settings or by contacting us.</p>

            <h3>11. International Transfers</h3>
            <p>Your information may be processed and stored in countries other than your own, including the United
                States, where our service providers operate. We rely on appropriate safeguards for such transfers.</p>

            <h3>12. Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>PureSkin is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or 16 in certain jurisdictions). We do not
                knowingly collect personal data from children. If we become aware that we have collected such data, we
                will take steps to delete it immediately.</p>
